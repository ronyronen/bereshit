# Matala Bereshit:
1. Bereshit.xlsx: Excel which contains 4 tabs: [Bereshit.xlsx](docs/Bereshit.xlsx)
- Real: Grabbed the data from TV.
- Manual Driving
- Final Results: The results captured from the Java program. Those are based on the auto driving.
2. PDF: Investigation.[investigation.pdf](docs/investigation.pdf)


# Results:
There are 3 algorithms:
1. A controller based on manual driving as described in the excel. Results show a nice descending.
